# Reflection — Cascading Trust Failure

If spoofing is possible at Layer 2,  
then packets can be misrouted at Layer 3.

This pattern continues upward.

## How Attackers Succeed
Attackers rarely fight systems directly.

They succeed by:
- Exploiting normal behavior
- Leveraging cost-minimizing assumptions
- Abusing long-lived trust relationships

Systems fail not because they are weak —  
but because they are **too trusting**.

---

## Designing Safer Systems
Resilient design requires:
- Reducing implicit trust
- Verifying critical assumptions
- Observing behavior before automating decisions
- Designing for failure, not perfection

---

## Final Takeaway
Defense is not about preventing every failure.

It is about:
- Detecting failure early
- Limiting damage
- Maintaining control under stress

Trust should expire — not persist.
