# ICMP and Routing Attacks

## Role of ICMP
ICMP supports:
- Reachability testing (`ping`)
- Path discovery (`traceroute`)
- Network diagnostics and error reporting

It operates at the network layer and assumes cooperative forwarding by intermediate devices.

---

## Control-Plane Trust
ICMP is trusted to:
- Deliver truthful diagnostic signals
- Reflect real network conditions
- Support routing and troubleshooting decisions

This trust is not enforced.

---

## Lab Observation
During live packet capture:
- ICMP traffic generated by the host was not observable
- Upstream infrastructure filtered or proxied ICMP silently

This demonstrates that control-plane traffic can be altered or suppressed without breaking connectivity.

---

## IP Spoofing and Routing Abuse
Network-layer attacks exploit trust in:
- Source IP addresses
- Routing announcements
- Neighbor cooperation

Examples include:
- IP spoofing for impersonation
- Reflection-based DDoS attacks
- Routing poisoning and hijacking

Even valid IP addresses can be malicious when assumed legitimate.

## Key Insight
Control-plane trust is fragile.

When visibility disappears, attackers exploit silence —  
while defenders misinterpret stability.
