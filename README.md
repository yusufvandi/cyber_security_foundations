# cyber_security_foundations
This repository documents my long-term exploration of **cybersecurity from first principles**, focusing on how trust is established, abused, and defended across system layers.

Rather than centering on tools, exploits, or certifications, this project emphasizes **how systems behave under normal conditions — and how attackers exploit that behavior without breaking the rules**.

## What This Project Focuses On

- Trust as a security boundary
- Assumptions embedded in protocols and systems
- Why “working as designed” can still mean “insecure”
- How attackers exploit normal, compliant behavior
- Designing defenses that prioritize resilience over perfection

---

## How the Project Evolves

The repository is organized into progressive learning phases, each examining security at different layers of modern systems.

Each phase:
- challenges assumptions from earlier stages
- builds upward from lower-layer trust models
- refines defensive thinking from prevention to resilience

Reflections are included intentionally to document **how my understanding changes over time**, not just what I learn.

## Learning Philosophy

Most real-world security failures do not come from broken systems.

They emerge when:
- trust is granted too early
- assumptions persist too long
- legitimate behavior is abused at scale

Security, therefore, is not only a technical problem — it is a **design and trust problem**.

This repository represents my attempt to study cybersecurity as such.
